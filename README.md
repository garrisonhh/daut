# DAUT

Deutsch Analysator mit umgekehrten Tries is my capstone paper for my German
bacheror's at Case Western Reserve University. The program was originally
written as a research project with Dr. Ronald Loui, and then later expanded upon
and written about. I've left the final draft in the repo as well, however since
it was written for a humanities audience rather than computer scientists it is
relatively surface level about the actual techniques I used.


## Getting Started

`examples.py` shows some of the ways that DAUT can be used, if you're reading
the code or want to see DAUT in action it's a good place to start!

DAUT requires python 3.9, then you can just `python examples.py` after
uncommenting an example usage!
